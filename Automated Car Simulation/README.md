# 🏎️ Automated-Car-Simulation NEAT using OpenAI Gym & CV2  

This project demonstrates how a car learns to navigate a track using **NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)** — a genetic algorithm that evolves neural networks over generations. The car’s behavior is simulated in a custom environment built with **OpenAI Gym** and **OpenCV** for visual rendering.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
The simulation evolves a population of cars to drive autonomously around a track.  
Each car uses a neural network (generated by NEAT) to interpret sensor data and decide movements.  
Over time, the best-performing cars survive and improve — eventually mastering the track without explicit training data.

## 🧠 Key Features  
- **Custom Car Environment** built with OpenCV and Gym-style interactions.  
- **NEAT-powered Evolution**: neural networks evolve to improve driving ability.  
- **Fitness Evaluation** based on distance, survival time, and efficiency.  
- **Elite Archive System**: saves top genomes across generations.  
- **Real-time Visualization** of cars learning to drive.

## 🧩 How It Works  

- **Initialization:**  
  A population of neural networks is created randomly.  

- **Evaluation:**  
  Each network controls a car in the simulation and receives a fitness score based on performance.  

- **Evolution:**  
  NEAT selects the fittest individuals and breeds new generations through mutation and crossover.  

- **Visualization:**  
  You can watch the cars evolve and improve in real time.

## 📊 NEAT Configuration  

- **Evolution Parameters:**  
  The training process is governed by the `neat_config.txt` file, which defines how networks evolve across generations.  

- **You can tune parameters such as:**  
  - Population size  
  - Fitness threshold  
  - Mutation probabilities  
  - Connection and node addition rates  

This allows fine-tuning how quickly or effectively networks adapt to the environment.

## 🏁 Results  

After several generations, the evolved neural networks successfully learn to navigate the track — avoiding collisions, maintaining smoother turns, and optimizing their path length.  
Each new generation shows noticeable improvements in control, stability, and efficiency.
