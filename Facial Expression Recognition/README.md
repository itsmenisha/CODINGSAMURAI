# Facial Expression Recognition

## Overview

This project implements a **Facial Expression Recognition** system using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It classifies human facial expressions into seven categories: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral**.

The project was developed as part of an **Artificial Intelligence Internship at Coding Samurai**.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the **<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013" target="_blank">FER2013 Dataset on Kaggle</a>**:

- ~35,000 grayscale images of size 48×48 pixels  
- Each image is labeled with one of seven emotions

## Project Workflow

### 1. Training the Model

- Training was performed in **Google Colab** to leverage GPU acceleration.  
- Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, converted into a **DataFrame**, and features were extracted from images.  
- The **CNN model** was built using TensorFlow/Keras with layers including convolution, batch normalization, pooling, dropout, and softmax classifier.  

**Training process:**  
- First round: 150 epochs, batch size 31 → ~65% accuracy  
- Applied **callbacks** (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau) and **data augmentation** (rotation, shifting, zoom, horizontal flip)  
- Second round: 150 epochs, batch size 64  
- Third round: 150 epochs, batch size 64 (continuous fitting)  
- Final accuracy: **66.34%**  

> Some predictions were initially incorrect (e.g., anger predicted as fear, neutral as angry), which improved after augmentation and callbacks.

The trained model was exported as a `.keras` file for testing.

### 2. Real-Time Testing

- The trained model was tested using **OpenCV** in **Visual Studio Code**.  
- Faces were detected with Haar cascades, converted to grayscale, resized to 48×48 pixels, and fed into the CNN for emotion recognition.  
- Real-time webcam predictions are displayed with bounding boxes and emotion labels.

### 3. Cleaning the Notebook

- To share the Colab notebook on GitHub, widgets were removed using a Python script that cleans notebook metadata.  
- The cleaned notebook is available in the repository.
